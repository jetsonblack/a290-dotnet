given 3 topics, we are going to provide information on a given topic to a uninformed reader.
## Part A:

	provide 3 URIs (FULL URLs) for information on the topic
## Part B:

	Write a Precis (Which has two possible strategies (organizations of information)
	-A Preci is my own objective condensation of what the author is trying to inform me of.
	(EG: given a three page article, write (in my own words) a objective retelling of this topic in a shorter retelling) 
		-Somewhere around 6 strong paragraphs
		-or write a Preci for each article, with 2 paragraphs for each article.
## Part C:

	This is a **summary**, where I as a writer am able to utilize my own opinion and be a little less objective in my retelling of the Author's articles
	-give a professional opinion of the topic, Why do I think my takeaway is more important than the author's
	-make sure to write for a uninformed reader
	
## Part D(Kinda):
	
	JIT Question for this topic.


**You will complete this 3 Times for each Topic**

### Reminder
	Know you 'user'
	Consistency of elements and style
	Provide clear navigation
	Logical grouping of tasks
	Prioritization of visual elements
	Care for the User.

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor <- build web apps with C# instead of JS, might be useful for building a download manager.
	-use this framework to build a web application that allows users to create a user instance (with a google account) that will provide a blank space for a pin list, download manager, and a TODO and a chat box
	-Try to host on silo possibly.

## CLR, CTS, CLS
### Base Class Libraries
	-Data access
	-Window Form 
	-Security
	-XML/SOAP
	-Threading
	-File I/O
	-Web Forms
	-ETc.
These libaries allow us to communicate with the Runtime (by extension the hardware) 
### What does this mean to me
A very large and common library
#### This library include
	-pre coded solutions to many programming problems
	-A virtual machine to manage program execution
#### Frees programmer from:
	-Most syntax errors.
	-Language-specific "includes"
	-CPU-specific issues
	-Memory management issues.
	-Exception handling


## QUICK INTRO to VSstudio and .NET
### First thing is to find the correct VSstudio
	Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit) - Current
	Version 17.11.0
-Sign in with my IU id.
### Config Operations:
	Make sure to go to Tools and Features. Designate the workloads I need to have.
	Make sure to have A Verison 17.11.X
## File Location Work
Go to Project and Solutions -> Locations +
	Directory on my USB for all 3
	-Project Location
	-Project Template location
	-User Item Template Location
		```E:\A290DOTNET```

# program, or a "distributable component"
### Object Basics
-Forms.
-Controls
	-visible-button.
	-standardizaed OpenFileDialog for Windows.
All objects have properties.
(Good practive is to pick a naming convention.)
Make sure to select the correct data type
	eg: Double takes up twice as much mem as a float

We are more than likely going to be programming from a event driven perspective. 
	-either objects, enviroment or human events
