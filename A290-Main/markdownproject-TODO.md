# Things left in main for functionality

## **Big items**
<u>Fix ctrl+backspace not working after the first press</u>

<u>create a `universal` mode keybind that instantly closes any mode for example, if I am in Underline mode, and I want to complete the mode toggle but don't want to search for the keybind ctrl+U because its annoying so I `universal` keybind that does it for me that being ctrl+q</u>

<u>create a cancel mode keybind, that will exit a mode without encapsulating the message in markdown ctrl+d</u>

*if there is time add simple vim control keybinds, meaning that there is `dd` to delete a whole line or ctrl+shift+g which would place you at the button of a document*

figure out a way to keep use tab inside the textbox and not have it shift focus away from the textbox


investigate why sometimes the renderer freezes (maybe has something to do with using multiple modes at once)
-create a refresh button that refreshes the entire program as a bandaid fix for when freezing occurs maybe control+R or something like that
keep cursor at the same spot after undos/redos

# Functionalities that I want to include if there is time

-option to remove a lot of UI and instead use a vim style editing system with a single command line that shows the modes and commands to be entered with :
-option to remove/enable word wrap in the text box
-option to darkmode the program
-option to add a word counter
-option to have word lines
-ctrl+save that automatically saves to file without opening up the file i/o if that file already exists.
-figure out how to change font in web render
-when maximized, have the textbox and the web render taking up the majority of the screen
